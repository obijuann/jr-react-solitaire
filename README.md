# JS React Solitaire

A simple Solitaire App written in React. 

Note, this is a personal project just to keep my skills current. It's not intended to be a long-term project, but I plan to add to it as inspiration strikes. 

## TODO

These are some of the changes I'm still planning to make

- Enable Undo/Redo
- Card animation
- Configuration of game settings (e.g. timer/no-timer, card back design, etc.)
- Saving game state to local storage for resumption on next load

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. \
The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
